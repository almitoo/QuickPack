Many travelers have difficulty before packing their bag/suitcase for the trip they have planned. 
Most travelers postpone this task until the last minute, which usually also causes overpacking or forgetting essential items.
In addition, the packing process can be long and tedious, especially for those who are used to long hours or busy schedules.

The purpose of the QuickPack application is to streamline the packing process and ensure that they do not forget essential things or alternatively take unnecessary things with them.
With QuickPack packing for every trip becomes easy. The app includes predefined categories that contain details that the traveler may need on the trip.
The app also allows editing of each category by adding/deleting an item.
QuickPack doesn't just provide lists. It also allows you to effortlessly update your travel dates on the integrated calendar, ensuring your packing timeline
lines up perfectly with your itinerary. Plus, with the built-in integration of Google Maps, you can research your destination right from the app, helping you pack for the specific needs of your trip.
The application has additional features such as a user profile. 
The application is based on a profile for each user with their personal data (Firebase Auth to manage users).
In addition, the application saves all the user's information in real time 
( Firebase real time database)

Important note:
If the user wants to save his event also in the Google calendar application as the application offers
The user will need to have the Google calendar app installed on his phone, otherwise he will receive a message warning that there is no app that supports the action.
